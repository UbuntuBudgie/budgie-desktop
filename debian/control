Description: Desktop package for budgie-desktop
 Budgie is the flagship desktop of the Solus Linux Distribution,
 a Solus project. Designed with the modern user in mind, it focuses on 
 simplicity and elegance. A huge advantage for the Budgie desktop is 
 that it is not a fork of another project, but rather one written from 
 scratch with integration in mind.
